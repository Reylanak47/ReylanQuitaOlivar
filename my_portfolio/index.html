        I’m a student who loves coding, building web projects, and experimenting with ideas like

    <!-- About details -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a student developer who spends a lot of time in front of a laptop—coding, learning,
        gaming, and turning random ideas into working projects. I like building things that feel
        useful in real life, not just something to submit for a requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m especially interested in web development and backend logic. I enjoy taking a simple
        idea like “what if there was a better way to find a boarding house?” and slowly turning it
        into a real system like BalayKo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of what I know comes from trial and error: reading docs, breaking things, fixing
        them, and slowly understanding how everything connects—from the front end to the database.

    <!-- How I work -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How I Learn &amp; Work</h2>
      <p>
        I learn by doing. That means dealing with Git errors, fixing broken layouts, and trying
        different approaches until something finally works. I commit my progress to GitHub so I
        can see how my code and thinking improve over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like starting with something simple, then improving it bit by bit—cleaning the UI,
        organizing the folders, refining features, and making the system more stable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Outside of code -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Outside of Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I’m usually in front of the same laptop—but gaming, watching videos,
        or planning ideas I may or may not actually build. I like switching between “deep focus”
        mode and “chill mode” so I don’t burn out while learning.
