        I use this space as a dev log and journal for my projects like BalayKo, this portfolio,
        and whatever I’m currently experimenting on. It’s not perfect, but it’s real.

          <h2>BalayKo: Why I’m Building a Student Housing Platform</h2>
          <p class="post-meta">Project dev log · BalayKo</p>
          <p>
            BalayKo started as a simple idea: make it less stressful for students to find a place
            to stay. Boarding houses, dorms, apartments — most of the time, information travels
            through friends, random Facebook posts, or “may alam ka bang vacant?” conversations.
            There’s no single, organized place just for student housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with BalayKo is to build a focused platform for students and landlords.
            Students should be able to see listings with clear details, prices, locations, and
            photos instead of guessing. Landlords should have a simple way to post and manage
            their properties without needing to be “techy”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core idea is two sides: <strong>tenants</strong> and <strong>landlords</strong>.
            Tenants can browse, favorite, and (in the future) request bookings for short or
            long stays. Landlords can create listings, upload multiple images, and manage
            their spaces in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the technical side, I’m experimenting with a stack that matches what I use in
            school projects: Node.js, Express, EJS templates, and a database behind it. Right now
            it’s more of a prototype, but the vision is bigger — something that can eventually
            be used as a thesis system and maybe a real startup for local student housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            BalayKo is still in progress, but every commit teaches me something new about
            structure, data, and how real-world problems are more complicated than “just code”.

          <h2>What I Learned Building My First Portfolio Website</h2>
          <p class="post-meta">Dev log · Portfolio</p>
          <p>
            This portfolio at <strong>reylanquitaolivar.netlify.app</strong> is my first real
            attempt at putting myself online as a student developer. It looks simple on the
            surface, but getting it from “idea” to “live website” taught me a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with the basics: HTML for the structure, CSS for the dark theme and layout,
            and a tiny bit of JavaScript just to handle small things like the year in the footer.
            Then I organized everything into a clean folder structure, with separate files for
            styles and scripts. It seems obvious now, but it really helps to keep things tidy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was learning to use Git and GitHub properly. Initializing a repository,
            committing changes, and pushing to a remote repo made me feel more like a “real”
            developer. I also hit common errors like “fetch first” or issues with folders and
            paths, but fixing them taught me how Git actually thinks about changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deploying to Netlify was another big moment. At first I got 404 errors and broken
            links because my publish directory and paths weren’t set correctly. After some trial
            and error, I learned how to point Netlify to the proper folder and how each deploy
            connects to my GitHub branch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this portfolio is still small, but it’s a start. It gives me a home base to
            link my projects, write dev logs like this, and gradually build up a public record of
            what I’m learning as a student developer.
